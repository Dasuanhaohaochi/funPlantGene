## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [HORVU.MOREX.r2.3HG0273500](https://ensembl.gramene.org/id/HORVU.MOREX.r2.3HG0273500)
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>HvLUX1</u>
- **Gene Name:** haplotype 1 LUX
- **Genome:** [MorexV3_pseudomolecules_assembly](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Hordeum_vulgare/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Hordeum vulgare*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **HvLUX1** is a candidate gene underlying the early maturity 10 locus in barley: phylogeny, diversity, and interactions with the circadian clock and photoperiodic pathways.
   - We proposed **HvLUX1**, an ortholog of the Arabidopsis circadian gene LUX ARRHYTHMO, as a candidate underlying the early maturity 10 (eam10) locus in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.).
   - The results of phylogenetic and diversity analyses indicate that **HvLUX1** was under purifying selection, duplicated at the base of the grass clade, and diverged independently of LUX-like genes in other plant lineages.
   - Based on the results of phylogenetic and diversity analyses, we conclude that **HvLUX1** was under purifying selection, duplicated at the base of the grass clade, and diverged independently of the LUX-like genes in other plant lineages.
