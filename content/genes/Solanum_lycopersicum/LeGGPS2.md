## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>LeGGPS2</u>
- **Gene Name:** geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase2
- **Genome:** [Tomato Genome version SL4.0](https://solgenomics.net/organism/solanum_lycopersicum/genome)
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - LeGGPS1 was predominantly expressed in leaf tissue and **LeGGPS2** in ripening fruit and flower tissue.
   - Expression of **LeGGPS2** was not induced in leaves by spider mite-feeding, wounding, JA- or MeSA-treatment.
   - This showed that LeGGPS1 transcripts are predominantly present in leaf tissue, whereas **LeGGPS2** transcripts are most abundant in fruits and flower organs.
   - This treatment led to activation of SA-responsive genes as could be seen from the induction of PRP6. LeGGPS1 was also induced by this MeSA-treatment, whereas transcript levels of **LeGGPS2** and WIPI-2 were not affected.
