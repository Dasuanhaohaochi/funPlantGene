## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Solyc02g065770](https://solgenomics.net/locus/Solyc02g065770/view)
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlCOBRA-like</u>
- **Gene Name:** COBRA-like gene
- **Genome:** [Tomato Genome version SL4.0](https://solgenomics.net/organism/solanum_lycopersicum/genome)
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - We identified a tomato gene (**SlCOBRA-like**) homologous to Arabidopsis COBRA, and determined its role in fleshy fruit biology. 
   - The **SlCOBRA-like** gene is highly expressed in vegetative organs and in early fruit development, but its expression in fruit declines dramatically during ripening stages, implying a primary role in early fruit development.
   - Fruit-specific suppression of **SlCOBRA-like** resulted in impaired cell wall integrity and up-regulation of genes encoding proteins involved in cell wall degradation during early fruit development.
   - In contrast, fruit-specific overexpression of **SlCOBRA-like** resulted in increased wall thickness of fruit epidermal cells, more collenchymatous cells beneath the epidermis, elevated levels of cellulose and reduced pectin solubilization in the pericarp cells of red ripe fruits.
   - Our results suggest that **SlCOBRA-like** plays an important role in fruit cell wall architecture and provides a potential genetic tool for extending the shelf life of tomato and potentially additional fruits.
