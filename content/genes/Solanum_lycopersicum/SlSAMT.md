## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlSAMT</u>
- **Gene Name:** salicylic acid methyltransferase
- **Genome:** [Tomato Genome version SL4.0](https://solgenomics.net/organism/solanum_lycopersicum/genome)
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Silencing of **SlSAMT** led to a major reduction in **SlSAMT** expression and MeSA emission upon herbivory by spider mites, without affecting the induced emission of other volatiles (terpenoids).
   - **SlSAMT** expression was slightly induced in hp**SlSAMT** lines upon spider-mite infestation| however, this induction was severely reduced compared with the controls.
   - **SlSAMT** silencing reduces susceptibility of tomato to Fusarium wilt.
   - These findings are supportive of a major role for MeSA in this indirect defence response of tomato. **SlSAMT**-silenced tomato plants were less susceptible to a virulent strain of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, indicating that the direct defense responses in the roots are also affected in these plants.
