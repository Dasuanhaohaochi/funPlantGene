## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [EVM0036869.1]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CAMTA2</u>
- **Gene Name:** hyper-DMR-associated gene
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Pyrus pyrifolia*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - One of the genes, **CAMTA2** (EVM0036869.1), which contains a hypermethylated DMR in the penultimate exon region (gene body), was selected for functional analysis because a previous study showed that CAMTA is associated with plant senescence.
   - The expression level of **CAMTA2** was measured by qRT-PCR. As a result, the DNA methylation level and expression level of **CAMTA2** exhibited a significant negative correlation.
   - The fruit and callus treatments showed similar results, showing that DNA methylation plays an essential role during the fruit ripening of pears by regulating the gene expression of **CAMTA2**.
   - We further verify the function of a hyper-DMR-associated gene, **CAMTA2**, and demonstrate that overexpression of **CAMTA2** in tomato and pear callus inhibits fruit ripening.
